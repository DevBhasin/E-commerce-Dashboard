# E-Commerce Sales Dashboard

This is a small data analysis project I built using Python to explore sales data from an e-commerce website. The idea was to understand how revenue changes over time, and how many customers are repeat buyers.

# What this project does

- It reads a CSV file containing order details.
- Calculates total revenue earned daily.
- Shows how many customers are returning.
- Visualizes daily revenue using a line graph.
- Saves the graph as a PNG image.

# Tools & Libraries Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
